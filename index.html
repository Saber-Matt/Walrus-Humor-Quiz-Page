                    These blubbery behemoths come in two varies: Tusk-obvious and Tusk-elusive (shown above). Male
                    Walruses sport an impressive weapon of dental destruction,<br>
                    much like the <a
                        href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/ad/f1/a1adf1c4403ed6d93dbfada916463ba7.png">African
                        Elephant</a>. You know, teeth, although the female walrus' also have tusks, they are much
                    smaller than their male counterpart's.<br>
                    Baby Walrus also have tusks which "erupt" during the calf's first summer or fall.

                    Here's something you probly didn't know about this oceanic blub-ub-ub. In addition to looking like
                    whole county is out of moisturizer and their the ones who need it most.<br>
                    Walruses also have a rounded fusiform body. There's a word for you <a

            <p>
                This majestic crusader has a long list of enemies with which to contend, stemming from a dark and sorted
                past.<br>
                The details of which I'm not at liberty to divulge without first obtaining adequate proof of your
                intentions.

                Suffice to say walruses prefer to gather into groups of their own, where the only treachery comes from
                within. A group of walruses is called a herd.<br>
                Hundreds gather to sunbathe on the ice. During mating season, walruses amass by the thousands. Usually
                separated by gender, each with their own herds;<br>
                like the awkward beginning of a school dance.
